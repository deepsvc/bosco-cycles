                Had a pretty good experience in getting my Fuji CrossPro Ultegra
                Cyclocross serviced. Stanley was kind enough to get the bike
                serviced replaced parts as necessary. <br /> *All the service
                requirements are available and done with professional tools on a
                work station.
                <br /> *Service is done at a domestic place. So you can stand
                next to bike, see what work is going on and eat heads with your
                questions.
                <br /> *Parts if not available are procured from outside at no
                extra cost.
                <br /> *Call up and fix your time for bike service to avoid
                delays.
                <br /> Rest assured, your bike is in good hands even if there is
                a slight delay.

                Perfect. Lucky to find them. I was referred to them by a pro
                rider.
                <br /> Personal attention. Well trained. Stanly is the man! I
                serviced my cycle before a long tour.
                <br /> And also have taken his help for a few regular
                maintenance on some of my other cycles.
                <br /> I used to service with some of the best bike stores in
                bangalore.
                <br /> They are all very professional but usually need to get on
                a waitlist to find time with them.
                <br /> Also for routine service they can get needlessly
                expensive.
                <br /> With Stanly, quick work and good value. Highly recommend.
